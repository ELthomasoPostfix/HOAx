The benchmarks in this folder were submitted by [Tim Willemse](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/researchers/tim-willemse/) in the PGSolver
format and then translated to extended HOA using the
[pg2hoa.py](https://github.com/SYNTCOMP/hoa-tools/blob/master/pg2hoa.py) script from [hoa-tools](https://github.com/SYNTCOMP/hoa-tools).

These games are derived from the four properties that can be found in [this paper](https://lmcs.episciences.org/6812).
